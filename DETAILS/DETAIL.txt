API Gateway,
any request made, first will come to the API Gateway.
from API Gateway, the request will go to the three services.
Each service will have its own database.
all configuration will be deployed somewhere on the github. incase repeating, it will be picked up from the github.
via OKTA Auth., we can do authentiation to the services. if the client is authenticated, then only will be able to use the services.
all the services will be registered in a service registry.
so if any service up or down, we will get to know the same in the service registry. 
also if the services get registered, we will be able to call it via their names.

The request will first come to the user service. 
from there, it will fetch all the ratings belonging to that user.
then, all the hotels associated with those ratings and all this data will go back to the client.

user, which ratings to that user and for each of the rating, which hotel does one rating belong to.

the @Transient annotation in the Entities will basically ignore that particular field and will then save the rest of the stuff into the database.
